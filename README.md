# **Pizza Sales Performance Analysis**
**SQL | Microsoft Excel | Business Analytics**

---

## **Executive Summary**

This project analyzes pizza sales data to uncover **revenue trends**, **customer ordering behavior**, and **product performance**.  
**SQL** was used to extract and calculate key metrics, while **Microsoft Excel** was used to design an **interactive dashboard** that presents insights in a clear, business-ready format.

### **Key Highlights**
- Analyzed **$817,860** in total revenue  
- Evaluated **21,350 orders** and **49,574 pizzas sold**  
- Built a **KPI-driven Excel dashboard** to support operational and strategic decisions  

---

## **Business Problem**

The pizza restaurant lacked a **centralized view of sales performance**. Stakeholders needed answers to:

- Which days and hours drive the highest number of orders?
- Which pizza categories and sizes generate the most revenue?
- Which products consistently underperform?
- How does customer behavior affect average order value?

Without structured analysis and visualization, business decisions were based on assumptions rather than data.

## **Solution Overview**

**SQL-based analysis** was combined with an **Excel dashboard** to convert raw transaction data into actionable business insights.

### **Deliverables**
- Cleaned and structured sales data  
- SQL queries for KPI and trend analysis  
- Excel dashboard including:
  - **KPI cards**
  - **Daily and hourly order trends**
  - **Category and size-wise sales breakdown**
  - **Best and worst-selling pizza analysis**
